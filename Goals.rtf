Project Status & Short-Term Goal

Our current short-term goal is to assemble core gameplay mechanics and basic visuals
to produce a short gameplay trailer.

This trailer will be used to showcase the game publicly and later for fundraising
or pitching purposes.

At this stage, we prioritize clarity, feel, and readability over polish.
We are open to new ideas and gameplay suggestions that help make the game more fun
and visually understandable.
